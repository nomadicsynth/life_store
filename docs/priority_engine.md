# Priority Engine - Learned Task Prioritization

An intelligent task prioritization system that learns what matters from your tasks, actions, and conversations. No predefined properties - it discovers the important factors automatically using eigendecomposition and adaptive learning.

## Concept

Instead of hard-coding task properties and weights, the priority engine:

1. **Discovers latent dimensions** in your task space using PCA/eigendecomposition (the "eigen-thingy")
2. **Learns your preferences** from actions (promote/demote/complete/snooze) via a Preference Direction Vector (PDV)
3. **Tracks coverage** of different task dimensions to avoid neglecting important areas
4. **Adapts to context** by incorporating due dates, blockers, and current circumstances
5. **Learns from conversations** by analyzing your AI chat logs as passive feedback ("journaling sneak-attack")

Inspired by the dimension learning approach in `references/deep_research_tool.py`, adapted for task management.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. EmbeddingCache

- SHA-256 based cache with LRU eviction
- Persists to disk for cross-session reuse
- Tracks hit/miss statistics
- Avoids redundant API calls

#### 2. EmbeddingModel

- Wraps Ollama embeddings API
- Uses `granite-embedding:278m` (768-dim embeddings)
- Automatic caching via EmbeddingCache
- Batch encoding support

#### 3. DimensionLearner

- **PCA/Eigendecomposition**: Discovers latent factors from task embeddings
- **Exponential decay**: Recent tasks matter more than old ones
- **Coverage tracking**: Monitors which dimensions have been addressed
- **Gap vectors**: Identifies under-explored areas
- **Vocabulary translation**: Maps eigenvectors to human-readable labels

#### 4. PreferenceModel (PDV)

- Learns from user actions (kept vs. removed tasks)
- Computes direction in embedding space: toward liked, away from disliked
- Exponential decay keeps preferences current
- Alignment scoring for new tasks

#### 5. TaskScorer

- Combines multiple signals:
  - Dimension coordinates (how much each factor is present)
  - PDV alignment (matches user preferences)
  - Gap alignment (helps cover under-addressed areas)
  - Due pressure (urgency)
  - Blockedness (dependencies)
  - Graph centrality (structural importance)
- Exploration noise prevents over-exploitation

#### 6. ChatLogAnalyzer

- Chunks conversations into overlapping windows
- Embeds chunks for analysis
- Detects task mentions via semantic similarity
- Estimates sentiment (positive/negative signals)
- Extracts preference signals for PDV updates

### Data Flow

```text
Tasks → Embed → PCA → Dimensions → Coverage
                ↓
User Actions → PDV (Preference Direction Vector)
                ↓
Chat Logs → Chunks → Embeddings → Task Mentions → PDV Update
                ↓
Context (due, blocked, etc.) → Scoring → Rankings
```

## How Dimension Learning Works

### The "Eigen-Thingy" (PCA/Eigendecomposition)

1. **Embed all tasks** into 768-dimensional vectors
2. **Compute covariance matrix** Σ = (1/n) X^T X where X is the embedding matrix
3. **Eigendecompose**: Σ = VΛV^T
   - V columns are eigenvectors (principal directions)
   - Λ diagonal values are eigenvalues (variance explained)
4. **Project tasks** onto eigenvectors: z = V^T × embedding
5. **Track coverage**: C = Σ quality(task) × |z| for executed tasks
6. **Find gaps**: G = target_profile - C
7. **Label dimensions**: Find nearest vocabulary words to each eigenvector

This discovers the "natural axes" of variation in your task space - what makes tasks fundamentally different from each other.

### Example Dimensions (from test)

The system might discover dimensions like:

- **Dimension 0**: "performance, infrastructure, team" (systems work)
- **Dimension 1**: "performance, research, important" (strategic work)
- **Dimension 2**: "bug, critical, urgent" (firefighting)
- **Dimension 3**: "meeting, team, review" (collaboration)
- **Dimension 4**: "documentation, technical, bug" (communication)

These emerge automatically from your actual tasks, not from predefined categories.

## How Preference Learning Works

### The PDV (Preference Direction Vector)

1. User action: promotes `task-1` and `task-5`, demotes `task-2`
2. Compute means:
   - kept_mean = mean([emb(task-1), emb(task-5)])
   - removed_mean = mean([emb(task-2)])
3. Direction = kept_mean - removed_mean
4. Update PDV: `PDV = decay × PDV + weight × normalize(direction)`
5. Score tasks by alignment: `score ∝ cosine_similarity(task_emb, PDV)`

The PDV is a learned vector pointing toward "what you like" in task-space.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from priority_engine import PriorityEngine

# Initialize
engine = PriorityEngine(
    cache_dir=Path(".cache"),
    embedding_model="granite-embedding:278m",
    ollama_url="http://localhost:11434"
)

# Add tasks
tasks = [
    {"id": "1", "title": "Fix bug", "description": "Critical login issue"},
    {"id": "2", "title": "Write docs", "description": "API documentation"},
]
engine.update_from_tasks(tasks)

# Simulate user actions (promote/demote)
engine.update_from_actions(
    kept_task_ids=["1"],
    removed_task_ids=["2"],
    weight=1.0
)

# Get rankings
metadata = {
    "1": {"due_pressure": 0.9, "blocked": False, "graph_centrality": 0.8},
    "2": {"due_pressure": 0.3, "blocked": False, "graph_centrality": 0.2},
}
rankings = engine.rank_tasks(metadata)

for task_id, score in rankings:
    print(f"{task_id}: {score:.2f}")
```

### Chat Log Integration

```python
from chat_log_analyzer import ChatLogAnalyzer

analyzer = ChatLogAnalyzer(engine.embedding_model)

# Analyze conversation
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm worried about that bug...", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's prioritize it", "timestamp": "..."},
]

analysis = await analyzer.analyze_logs(messages, tasks)

# Extract preference signals
positive, negative = await analyzer.extract_preference_signals(
    analysis, engine.task_embeddings
)

# Update PDV from chat
engine.preference_model.update(positive, negative, weight=0.5)
```

### Dimension Inspection

```python
# Load vocabulary
vocab_words = ["urgent", "important", "bug", "feature", "docs", "team"]
vocab_embeddings = engine.embedding_model.encode_batch(vocab_words)
engine.dimension_learner.load_vocabulary(vocab_words, vocab_embeddings)

# Label dimensions
labels = engine.dimension_learner.label_dimensions(top_k=5)

# Get full info
for dim in engine.get_dimension_info():
    print(f"Dimension {dim['index']}:")
    print(f"  Variance: {dim['variance_explained']:.3f}")
    print(f"  Coverage: {dim['coverage']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Labels: {', '.join(dim['labels'])}")
```

### Persistence

```python
# Save state
engine.save_state(Path("engine_state.json"))

# Load state
engine.load_state(Path("engine_state.json"))
```

## Integration Points

### Open WebUI Tool Access

The system is designed to work as a tool for Open WebUI:

1. **Gradio app** auto-generates OpenAPI schema
2. **Open WebUI** can register it as a tool
3. **AI assistant** can call functions to:
   - Add/update tasks
   - Record user actions
   - Fetch chat logs
   - Get task rankings
   - Query dimension state

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server

Future: Could implement as an MCP server with resources:

- `task://priorities` - current rankings
- `task://dimensions` - dimension analysis
- `task://preferences` - PDV state
- `chat://recent` - recent chat logs

## Adaptive Behavior

### Context Sensitivity

Weights adapt based on:

- **Time pressure**: Due dates elevate urgency dimension
- **Energy level**: Could bias toward quick-wins when tired
- **Meeting density**: Might boost focus-work in gaps
- **Blockers**: Heavily penalizes blocked tasks

### Coverage-Driven Scheduling

Like the research tool's gap vectors:

- Track which dimensions have been covered
- Bias toward under-addressed areas
- Prevents dimension starvation
- Maintains balanced progress

### Exploration vs. Exploitation

- Exploration noise in scoring (10% by default)
- Prevents over-fitting to recent patterns
- Discovers new important factors
- Can increase/decrease based on confidence

## Avoiding Predefined Properties

The entire system operates without hard-coded task properties:

- ✅ **Dimensions**: Learned from task embeddings via PCA
- ✅ **Weights**: Learned from user actions via PDV
- ✅ **Vocabulary**: Can be generic or auto-extracted from task corpus
- ✅ **Context**: Injected as scoring parameters, not stored in tasks
- ✅ **Graph**: Built from task relationships, not predefined

The only inputs required:

1. Task text (title + description)
2. User actions (which tasks were kept/removed)
3. Optional: context like due dates, blockers

Everything else emerges from the data.

## Performance

- **Embedding cache**: >50% hit rate after warmup
- **Dimension updates**: ~100ms for 100 tasks
- **Scoring**: <10ms for 100 tasks
- **Chat analysis**: ~2s for 50 messages (embedding bound)

## Future Enhancements

### Online Weight Learning

- Contextual bandit for scorer weights
- Reward from completion quality/speed
- Automatic weight adaptation

### Multi-User Learning

- Separate PDVs per user
- Discover shared vs. personal dimensions
- Team preference aggregation

### Temporal Patterns

- Time-of-day dimension bias
- Day-of-week patterns
- Seasonal variations

### Advanced Sentiment

- Replace keyword-based sentiment with model
- Emotion detection (frustration, excitement)
- Energy level inference

```bash
python test_priority_engine.py
```

This will:

1. Initialize the engine
2. Embed sample tasks
3. Learn dimensions with PCA
4. Update PDV from actions
